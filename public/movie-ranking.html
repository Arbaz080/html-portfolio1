<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>One Piece</h3>
<p>One piece is by far one of the Greatest anime ever created by the Japanese Manga Author and Legend Eiichiro Oda.<br />
   "It is a Story About a man Who wants to be the King of the Pirates."</p>
<h3>My Name is Khan</h3>
<p>A story about a man who wants to meet the President of the United States of America....Just to say "My name is Khan and I'm not a Terrorist."<br />The sole purpose for this act of him is to display the world that terrorists have no religion.<br />And Muslims Should not be troubled or harassed for being a Muslim.</p>
<h3>Swades</h3>
<p>Nothing to tell...Just go and watch the Movie.<br />
After watching the movie you'll get to know why SRK is called the Best Actor in the whole World. </p>
